# PROJECT TESTE BOOKSTORE SIMPLE DDD

This is my bookstore test project, implemented using the technology stack mentioned in the provided file.

I've developed it with simplicity and efficiency in mind, opting for a streamlined approach. Utilizing repositories to manage methods and services to establish a comprehensible structure has been pivotal in achieving this goal.

To run the project, follow these steps:
git clone <repository-url>
composer install
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
php artisan serve

Using XAMPP and Postman: Make sure you have XAMPP installed and running for the database server. You can test the endpoints using Postman by sending HTTP requests to the server URL.
